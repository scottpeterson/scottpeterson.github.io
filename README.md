This is a statistics focused website, with an even more specific focus on Division III Women's Basketball.

The main statistic published is the NCAA Power Index (NPI) for DIII Women's Basketball. This statistic is published by the NCAA, but only later in the year and less frequently. The aim here is to update NPI daily once the season starts.

This site will also house Season Simulations for DIII Women's Basketball. While current NPI is helpful, due to how NPI is calculated, future/projected NPI is heavily dependent on a team's future schedule. The simulations attempt to take that into account.

There are many other statistics and models published as well.
