              A lot of it is! But definitely not all (especially the upcoming
              weekly games with leverage parts) and you would have to do the

          <div class="honor-content">
            <p>
              Talk about it all you want! In fact, please do! Discussing
              insights from the report with teammates, coaches, and fellow fans
              helps spread awareness about D3 basketball analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
              What we ask is that you don't forward the actual PDF file to
              others. These reports represent countless hours of data
              collection, model development, and analysis, all done by one
              person who's passionate about D3 basketball. The value isn't
              necessarily in the individual data points (much of which is
              available elsewhere), but in the aggregation, presentation, and
              convenience of having everything in one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your purchase is for your personal access to that curated
              experience. If others find the insights you share valuable, we
              hope they'll consider getting their own subscription. That's what
              keeps this service sustainable and allows us to keep providing
              these analytics to the D3 community.
            </p>

              Thank you for respecting the work that goes into these reports and
