      <p>
        <strong>Please don't.</strong> These reports represent countless hours
        of data collection, model development, and analysisâ€”all done by one
        person who's passionate about D3 basketball. While there's no way to
        technically prevent sharing, the viability of this service depends on
        people doing the right thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your purchase is intended for <strong>your personal use only</strong>.
        When you share your report with teammates, coaches, or fellow fans, it
        undermines the work that makes this service possible and makes it harder
        to keep providing these insights to the D3 community.
      </p>
      <p class="honor-thanks">
        Thank you for respecting the effort that goes into these reports and for
        supporting independent D3 basketball analytics. Your integrity keeps
        this service alive.
