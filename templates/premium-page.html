        Isn't most of this data available somewhere on this website already?
      </h3>
      <p>
        A lot of it is! But definitely not all (especially the upcoming weekly
        games with leverage parts) and you would have to do the work to find
        your team on each page to cobble the information together. This product
        presents it all in one spot. You're buying convenience and extra
        statistics.

  <section class="premium-honor">
    <h2>Can I share this report with others?</h2>
    <div class="honor-content">
      <p>
        Talk about it all you want! In fact, please do! Discussing insights from
        the report with teammates, coaches, and fellow fans helps spread
        awareness about D3 basketball analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we ask is that you don't forward the actual PDF file to others.
        These reports represent countless hours of data collection, model
        development, and analysis, all done by one person who's passionate about
        D3 basketball. The value isn't necessarily in the individual data points
        (much of which is available elsewhere), but in the aggregation,
        presentation, and convenience of having everything in one place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your purchase is for your personal access to that curated experience. If
        others find the insights you share valuable, we hope they'll consider
        getting their own subscription. That's what keeps this service
        sustainable and allows us to keep providing these analytics to the D3
        community.
      </p>
      <p class="honor-thanks">
        Thank you for respecting the work that goes into these reports and for
